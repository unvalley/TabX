## Instlattion

- Please wait for Firefox.

## Motivation

> The problem of having too many tabs open occurs when we use a browser. Opening too many tabs affect memory consumption and prevent comfortable browsing.
> Recently, some extensions and browsers have approached this problem, but they are a bit overloaded, at least for me.
> This extension is inspired by OneTab.
> The goal of TabX is to create a simpler and easier to use tab management tool.
